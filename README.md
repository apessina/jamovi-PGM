# jamovi-PGM

`PGM - Practical Growth Modeling` is an R-based package for
[jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org) that facilitates biological growth
modeling through curve fitting, graphical analysis, calculation of fit
quality and key growth parameters.

## Installation in jamovi

You can install `PGM` by downloading the `.jmo` file available in the
last release of this repository and side-load it directly on jamovi
interface. There is also an example dataset to test and learn how to use
this package.

## Acknowledgements

This package uses Levenberg-Marquardt Nonlinear Least-Squares Algorithm
found in
[minpack.lm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/minpack.lm/index.html)
to fit some model parameters to user data.

Richards model form was based on Equation 9 of [Tjørve and Tjørve
(2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.008).
